# Project Overview

## Backend

The backend uses a database table named `membership_plans`, and all core CRUD operations are handled within the `MembershipPlanController`.

I aimed to build a clean, secure, and maintainable structure. This project represents my first real-world experience using Laravel. I acknowledge that there might be some architectural inconsistencies or beginner-level mistakes, and I sincerely apologize if any are found.

All logical operations and database queries were written manually as I wanted to gain hands-on experience with Laravel's architecture. I have performed several tests, and so far, the system appears to function without any major issues.

## Frontend

On the frontend side, I prioritized a simple and easy-to-understand layout. I intentionally avoided modals and collapsible elements to keep the user experience straightforward and clear.

Since I am not particularly skilled in UI/UX design or color palette selection, I utilized AI-assisted tools to help define a consistent theme and layout. I believe this approach helped me achieve a visually acceptable and functional design. Overall, the interface is minimalistic but intended to provide an intuitive user experience.
